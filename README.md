# classification-challenge
Module 13 Challenge

For this challenge, I was tasked with an assignment assuming the role of a worker at Internet Service Provider (ISP) and tasked with improving the email filtering system for its customers. A dataset that contains information about emails was provided, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The ISP wants you to take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.

I created two classification models (Logistic Regression Model and Random Forest Model) to fit the provided data, and evaluated which model is more accurate at detecting spam. 
Although both models worked well, the Random Forest Classifier Model worked better. Please see the starter file "spam_detector.ipynb" for details.
